# Project


# I have attached a word document I use to template/organise my thoughts for any
# given study, and further detail is available in that.
#
# Suffice it to say however, we are interested in hip fracture patients who are
# know carriers but not necessarily infected with a multi-drug resistant
# organism (MDRO).
#
# Examples of these MDROs include MRSA/VRE etc.
#
# In order to prevent other patients from being colonised/cross contaminated by
# such organisms “MDRO patients” are isolated within the hospital i.e. put into
# private rooms, bypass theatre reception, not brought to general patient
# recovery area post op.
#
# While in theory this sounds fine, it actually really limits this cohort of
# patients’ access to basic care. Anecdotally they wait for much longer to get a
# bed on the ward and are left on trollies in ED far longer and also have to
# wait much longer to get to theatre for their broken hip…..but nobody has shown
# this.
#
# We have gotten hold of the national hip fracture data (which is a
# comprehensive, prospectively collected data set). It’s time to drive on with
# the study.
#
# Primary outcomes: Time to theatre for hip fracture Fixation, Time to ward bed
# from emergency department
#
# Secondary outcomes: Thirty day mortality, local cost analysis (we have more
# detailed data for waterford)
#
# In addition to my word document I have attached the data file.
#
# I have done some work on it to generate 3 extra tabs:
#
# The MDRO tab with no-anticoagulants is the tab we are most interested in. If
# someone is on blood thinners in the community, their hip fracture surgery is
# often delayed until the effect of these bloods thinners is either worn off or
# reversed. This is an obvious confounding factor, I have excluded them from the
# rest of the MDRO patients in this tab.
#
# The second extra tab is where I dumped the details of the anti-coagulated MDRO
# hips (i.e. MDRO hips on blood thinners in the community).
#
# The third tab is waterford hip fractures….these will hopefully form part of a
# secondary cost analysis depending how the study goes.
#
# Finally, I have attached 3 other papers which have run similar analysis to
# give you an idea of what we are after.
#
# I’m really looking forward to working with you on this. I’m excited by this
# project as I think it will arm us with information that will allow us to
# improve patient care.

# Best,
